## Executive Summary

This white paper introduces a new conceptual law: the **Law of Deep Representational Structure**, which proposes that the effectiveness of a representation—be it cognitive, computational, or hybrid—is not determined by the volume of information it holds, but by the way this information is hierarchically and semantically structured. It presents a systemic, scalable, and cross-domain principle for designing and evaluating intelligent systems.

The central thesis is that **deep, layered representations** enable compression without semantic loss, promote pattern reuse, and facilitate inference and generalization. They reflect the core architecture of efficient cognition and adaptive computation. In contrast, representations that succumb to *flattening forces*—pressures toward simplification, linearization, or reduction for the sake of clarity or accessibility—lose expressive power and inferential capacity.

This paper formalizes a relationship between representational depth and representational power, mediated by the **tendency toward structural flattening**. Such flattening may result from design choices, organizational constraints, or evolving user preferences. While flattening may offer short-term accessibility, it often sacrifices long-term systemic intelligence.

We propose an operational definition of representational depth, a framework for measuring flattening forces, and an equation expressing their inverse proportionality. The goal is to enable better design, analysis, and governance of symbolic, neural, and hybrid representational systems.

This law holds implications for artificial intelligence, cognitive modeling, systems architecture, educational design, and knowledge engineering. It provides a foundational shift in how representations are conceived—not merely as data containers, but as layered cognitive instruments that encode complexity in compact, generative forms.
